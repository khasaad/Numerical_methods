# Numerical_methods

Abstract: A model of transport-diffusion-antibody reaction in a tumor is presented. Antibodies react with antigens.
A numerical method is proposed for calculating the concentration of antibodies and antigens when the reaction rate is moderate.
The limit is then considered when the reaction rate tends towards the infinite and a second numerical scheme is proposed to treat this case.
Finally, the appearance of progressive waves is examined.
Key words: Partial differential equations, finite differences, stability.
