Abstract: A model of transport-diffusion-antibody reaction in a tumor is presented. Antibodies react with antigens.
A numerical method is proposed for calculating the concentration of antibodies and antigens when the reaction rate is moderate.
The limit is then considered when the reaction rate tends towards the infinite and a second numerical scheme is proposed to treat this case.
Finally, the appearance of progressive waves is examined.
Key words: Partial differential equations, finite differences, stability.

Goal:
Cancer cells synthesize tumor antigens that are attached to the cancerous tissue. The tumor is vascularized, that is to say that vessels irrigate it with blood. Antibodies are injected into the blood that will enter the cancerous tissue and "block" the antigens, that is, bind to them. This can be done for therapeutic purposes: by "blocking" the tumor antigens, the antibodies can prevent the proliferation of these. However, it is generally for diagnostic purposes that this method is used: by marking the injected antibodies (with iodine-125 for example), one can then count, by medical imaging, those which are fixed on cancerous antigens , and thus evaluate the extent of the tumor. Several types of antibodies can be used and not all behave in the same way: they can, for example, attach more or less rapidly to the antigens or penetrate more or less deeply into the tissue. Depending on the purpose - diagnostic or therapeutic - one will seek to obtain different behaviors. These behaviors depend on a very large number of factors: initial concentration of antibodies injected into the blood, size of the antibodies, chemical affinity, permeability of the tissue, etc. A mathematical model of these phenomena can help to better understand the in fl uence of the various parameters. He can thus guide the realization of experiment and help to choose the antibodies best adapted to a given situation.
